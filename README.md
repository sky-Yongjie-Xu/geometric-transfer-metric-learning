Geometric Transfer Metric Learning (GTML)
=========================================
This package contains the code for the paper ''Ship Classiﬁcation in SAR Images with Geometric Transfer Metric Learning''.

This paper has been submitted to the journal of IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING.

Part 1 - Framework of GTML for zero labeled sample (ZLS) task:
---------------------------------------
![image](image/ZLS_framework.pdf)

The model can be run by executing ZLS_GTML_A_main.m and ZLS_GTML_R_main.m in the code directory.

Part 2 - Framework of GTML for scarce labeled samples (SLS) task:
------------------------------------------
![image](image/SLS_framework.pdf)

The model can be run by executing SLS_GTML_A_main.m and SLS_GTML_R_main.m in the code directory.

Results
=============
All the algorithms are implemented and run using MATLAB. 

All the experiments are run on an AMD Processor 2.4 GHz machine, with 16 ˙GB RAM and Windows Server 2008 R2 standard operation system.
