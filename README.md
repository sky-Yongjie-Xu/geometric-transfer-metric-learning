This package contains the code for the paper ''Ship Classiﬁcation in SAR Images with Geometric Transfer Metric Learning''.

This article has been submitted to the journal of IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING.

Part 1 - Framework of GTML for zero labeled sample (ZLS) task:
---------------------------------------
![image](image/ZLS_framework.pdf)

The model can be run by executing ZLS_GTML_A_main.m and ZLS_GTML_R_main.m in the code directory.

Part 2 - Framework of GTML for scarce labeled samples (SLS) task:
------------------------------------------
